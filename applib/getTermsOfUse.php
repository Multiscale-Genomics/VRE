<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the <a href="https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu" target="_blank">https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu</a> website ("MuGVRE") operated by the MuG project consortium.</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, please refrain from accessing the Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to the portal</strong></p>
<p>Access to MuGVRE and the applications hosted is free and unrestricted. Upon first access, a unique URL is generated to allow recovering of the data space in later sessions.</p>
<p>Users desiring a longer interaction with MuGVRE can register to obtain a permanent workspace. </p>
<p>MuGVRE uses Keycloak software to manage authentication protocols. For registered users access is  protected by a username and password combination, issued by MuGVRE itself. Alternatively, existing trusted Id providers like Google, openID, LinkedIn, and ELIXIR can be associated with the assigned username. </p>
<p>MuGVRE portal supports https access, which ensures encryption of all transferred data. Authentication protocols are applied transparently to all data transactions between the user and the Portal, either interactively, or through REST based APIs to assure privacy.</p>
<p>MuGVRE will be available for use except in the event of hardware failure, programmed maintenance, or on grounds of force majeure. When known, disruptions of service will be warned in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of personal data</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Organic Law 15/1999 of December 13 on Protection of Personal Data, personal data used in the registration will be incorporated to a file property of the MuG Consortium and will be treated in a confidential way. Use of this file is restricted to the needs of MuGVRE and its contents will not be shared with third parties. Use of this file is restricted to the needs of MuGVRE and its contents will not be shared with third parties.  We remind you that at any time you may exert your rights of access, modification, cancellation or opposition by contacting MuG Coordinator IRB Barcelona in writing (IRB Barcelona, c/ Baldiri Reixac 10-12, 08028 Barcelona, Spain) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:vre@multiscalegenomics.eu">vre@multiscalegenomics.eu</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Execution environment</strong></p>
<p><strong>MuGVRE</strong> is running in a series of cloud infrastructures based at MuG partners premises (BSC, IRB Barcelona, EMBL-EBI). Physical compute clusters hosting the cloud infrastructures are physically protected and follows the security standards of hosting institutions. Direct access to the cluster are reserved to technical staff. Data transmission necessary for the internal activity of MuGVRE will use in all cases secure protocols (https, sftp). </p>
<p>Tools provided within MuGVRE are recognized in the field, and supported by their developers. MuGVRE may not offer the full functionality of the included tools, in comparison with their standalone versions. Details of the available functionality and the appropriate references can be found in the corresponding documentation section.</p>
<p><strong>Users’ data</strong></p>
<p>Our Service allows users to upload, and store information, research data, or other material, perform analyses on it, and download results. Additionally, MuGVRE allows to access selected public data repositories. </p>
<p>User’s data and results obtained (since they are generated automatically without MuG’s human intervention) are treated as confidential and remain the intellectual property of the user.</p>
<p>User’s data is held in a private virtual workspace. Unless agreed in other terms, users’ workspace is limited to 2GB storage size, and is maintained until termination of users’ relationship with MuG. For unregistered users, data is held 10 days after the last connection. For registered users, in case of long term inactivity (2 months), MuG reserves the right to archive users’ data and release the used storage. </p>
<p>Data held in the workspace is only accessible by its owner, although MuG operations staff may be requested to access it to solve eventual operational issues. When necessary, a confidentiality agreement may be formalized. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the required agreement is in place prior to uploading any confidential data. </p>
<p>Backup of users’ data is performed periodically following the internal policies of the hosting institutions. MuGVRE or the hosting institutions cannot be held liable for data loss in users’ workspace. Users are advised to keep a local copy of any data uploaded or produced by MuGVRE.</p>
<p>When necessary specific confidentiality agreements can be formalized.</p>
<p><strong>Right of Modification</strong></p>
<p>MuGVRE reserves the right to make any modification in the interface, available tools, or provided data to fix possible bugs, or extend or improve the functionality. Users will be warned in advance about any modifications that may alter user experience. When possible, back compatibility will be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>User support</strong></p>
<p><strong>MuGVRE</strong> provides support through two different channels: 1) A Scientific Forum where support on the use of tools or algorithms will be provided. Scientific forum requests will be addressed to tool developers and MuG experts. 2) A HelpDesk to address technical issues.  Note that Forum chats are not held confidential. </p>
<p><strong>Tools selection and Developers support</strong></p>
<p>Tools included in MuGVRE are selected by MuG's steering committee.</p>
<p>Inclusion of new tools  would require adaptation to the MuGVRE internal execution engine. Detailed documentation to do so is available, and MuGVRE staff will help as necessary. Failure to perform the adaptation will preclude the inclusion of the requested software.</p>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
<p>Licensing information on MuGVRE components is available in the documentation section (<a href="http://www.multiscalegenomics.eu/MuGVRE/documentation/" target="_blank">https://www.multiscalegenomics.eu/MuGVRE/documentation/</a>) . </p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>Users of MuGVRE agree in properly acknowledge the use of the infrastructure and the tools in any publication, either journal’s paper or scientific conference, derived from the results obtained totally or partially within the infrastructure. Appropriate acknowledge statements are available in the help section. </p>
<p><strong>Limitation of liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>MuGVRE</strong> service and the tools included therein are offered for research purposes only. MuG is not liable for the outcomes of any kind of decisions (commercial, clinical, etc.) taken as a consequence of its use. </p>
<p>Result data is provided “AS IS” and their accuracy and validity cannot be assured beyond the reported limits and conditions as stated in the tools documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
