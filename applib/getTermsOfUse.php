<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the <a href="https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu" target="_blank">https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu</a> website ("MuG VRE") operated by the MuG project consortium.</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, please refrain from accessing the Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to the portal</strong></p>
<p>MuG VRE portal supports https access, which ensures encryption of all transferred data.</p>
<p>MuG VRE uses Keycloak software to manage SSO authentication. Access to the portal is protected by a username and password combination, issued by MuG VRE itself. Alternatively, existing trusted Id providers like Google, openID, LinkedIn, and ELIXIR can be associated with the assigned username. Authentication applies to all data transactions between the user and MuG Portal, either interactively, or through REST based APIs. </p>
<p>MuG VRE will be available for use except in the event of hardware failure, programmed maintenance, or on grounds of force majeure. When known, disruptions of service will be warned in advance.</p>

We remind you that at any time you may exert your rights of access, modification, cancellation or opposition by contacting MuG Coordinator IRB Barcelona in writing (IRB Barcelona, c/ Baldiri Reixac 10-12, 08028 Barcelona, Spain) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:vre@multiscalegenomics.eu">vre@multiscalegenomics.eu</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Execution environment</strong></p>
<p><strong>MuG VRE</strong> is running in a series of cloud infrastructures based at MuG partners premises (BSC, IRB Barcelona, EMBL-EBI). Physical compute clusters hosting the cloud infrastructures are physically protected and follows the security standards of hosting institutions. Direct access to the cluster are reserved to technical staff. Data transmission necessary for the internal activity of MuG VRE will use in all cases secure protocols (https, sftp). </p>
<p>Tools provided within MuG VRE are recognized in the field, and supported by their developers. MuG VRE may not offer the full functionality of the included tools, in comparison with their standalone versions. Details of the available functionality and the appropriate references can be found in the corresponding documentation section.</p>
<p><strong>Users’ data</strong></p>
<p>Our Service allows you to upload, and store information, research data, or other material, perform analyses on it, and download results. Additionally, MuG VRE allows to access selected public data repositories. </p>
<p>User’s data and results obtained (since they are generated automatically without MuG’s human intervention) are treated as confidential and remain the intellectual property of the user.</p>
<p>User’s data is held in a private virtual workspace. Unless agreed in other terms, users’ workspace is limited to 2GB storage size, and is maintained until termination of users’ relationship with MuG. In case of long term inactivity (2 months), MuG reserves the right to archive users’ data and release the used storage. </p>
<p>Data held in the workspace is only accessible by its owner, although MuG operations staff may be requested to access it to solve eventual operational issues. When necessary, a confidentiality agreement may be formalized. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the required agreement is in place prior to uploading any confidential data. </p>
<p>Backup of users’ data is performed periodically following the internal policies of the hosting institutions. MuG VRE or the hosting institutions cannot be held liable for data loss in users’ workspace. Users are advised to keep a local copy of any data uploaded or produced by MuG VRE.</p>
<p>When necessary specific confidentiality agreements can be formalized.</p>
<p><strong>Right of Modification</strong></p>
<p>MuG VRE reserves the right to make any modification in the interface, available tools, or provided data to fix possible bugs, or extend or improve the functionality. Users will be warned in advance about any modifications that may alter user experience. When possible, back compatibility will be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>User support</strong></p>
<p><strong>MuG VRE</strong> provides support through two different channels: 1) A Scientific Forum where support on the use of tools or algorithms will be provided. Scientific forum requests will be addressed to tool developers and MuG experts. 2) A HelpDesk to address technical issues. Access to both utilities will be through the use of MuG VRE credentials. Note that Forum chats are not held confidential. </p>
<p><strong>Tools selection and Developers support</strong></p>
<p>Tools included in MuG VRE are selected by MuG steering committee.</p>
<p>Inclusion of new tools in the VRE would require adaptation to the VRE internal execution engine. Detailed documentation to do so is available, and MuG VREstaff will help as necessary. Failure to perform the adaptation will preclude the inclusion of the requested software.</p>
