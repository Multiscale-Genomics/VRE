					<p>Nucleosome positioning plays a major role in transcriptional regulation and most DNA-related processes. The nucleosome dynamics server offers different tools to analyze nucleosome positioning from MNase-seq experimental data and perform comparative experiments to account for the transient and dynamic nature of nucleosome positioning under different cellular states.</p>

<p>Two specific programs, nucleR and NucleosomeDynamics, were specifically developed to perform such studies:</p>

<ul>
<li>nucleR performs Fourier transform filtering and peak calling, in order to efficiently and accurately define and classify the location of nucleosomes.</li>
<li>NucleosomeDynamics compares different MNase-seq experiments identifying variations in nucleosomes location. It identifies upstream and downstream shifts, evictions, inclusions, and differences in nucleosome fuzzines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, a list of other nucleosome related features, like the location of nucleosome-free regions, the theoretical prediction of nucleosome phasing at gene level, the classification of transcription start sites based on the surrounding nucleosomes, and the stiffness of the nucleosomes derived from a fitting of nucleosome profiles into a Gaussian function, are also computed.</p>
