					<p>TADbit is a complete Python library to deal with all steps to analyze, model and explore 3C-based data. With TADbit the user can map FASTQ files to obtain raw interaction binned matrices (Hi-C like matrices), normalize and correct interaction matrices, identify adn compare the so-called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), build 3D models from the interaction matrices, and finally, extract structural properties from the models. TADbit is complemented by TADkit for visualizing 3D models.</p>

					<p>Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction between loci located in the same or in different chromosomes. TADbit is built around the concept of a chromosome, and uses it as a central item to store and compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has been designed to be used by researchers with no expertise in computer science. All-in-one scripts provided in TADbit allow to run the full analysis using one single command line; advanced users may produce their own programs using TADbit as a complementary library.</p>
