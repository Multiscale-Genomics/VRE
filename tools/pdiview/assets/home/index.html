					<p>Analyse a protein-DNA complex 3D structure to identify interactions and study
					their impact on specific binding by integrating experimental data on the
					protein's DNA specificity.</p>


					<p>3DConsensus allows the interpretation of experimental data on DNA-binding
					specificity of a protein through the analysis of a 3D structure of the
					complex.</p>


					<p>3DConsensus calculates from the experimental data a sequence-only consensus, as
					well as a consensus based on the physical properties of DNA. To gain insight
					into the molecular details of the behaviour encoded in the experimental data,
					3DConsensus analyses the 3D structure to extract conformational parameters of
					the DNA in the protein-DNA complex, as well as the specific interactions that
					stabilise the complex. </p>
