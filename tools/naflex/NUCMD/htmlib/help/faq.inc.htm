    <label for="q1">How many snapshots do you store for each simulation?</label>
    <p>	To allow an easy but still representative data download, data directly available from the web portal consist on <strong>5,000 frames</strong> of dry, imaged trajectories. 

	Downloadable trajectories are <strong>fully consistent</strong> with the pre-calculated analysis available at the web site. 

	<strong>Full trajectories</strong> are available <strong>on-request</strong>.

    <label for="q2">Why do you use two different noSQL databases?</label>           
    <p>
	In this project we have chosen two of such database managers: <strong>Cassandra</strong>, to store trajectory data and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, to store analysis results and metadata.

	The two kind of database managers show characteristics that are appropriate for the <strong>BIGNASim DB</strong> purposes.

	On one side, <strong>Cassandra</strong> is a <strong>column-oriented database</strong>, especially efficient in the retrieval of key-value pairs. Simplicity of data structure is key to boost that retrieval efficiency. This makes it ideal to store trajectory data that is composed by a uniform series of Cartesian coordinates that should be obtained in well-defined data blocks.

	On the other hand, <strong>MongoDB</strong> is a <strong>document oriented database</strong>, where data should not follow a rigid schema. MongoDB may store from single values, to 2D or 3D data, or even full length trajectory videos within a single document. Additionally, MongoDB provides GridFS, a file-system like platform to store files in its original format. Its flexibility, especially with respect to the structure of the stored documents, allows using a common data structure both in the database and in the analysis 

	Capacity of both systems scales horizontally and they may coexist in the same computer equipment.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q3">
    <label for="q3">Can I upload my own simulation?</label>
    <p> <strong>BIGNASim</strong> server offers the possibility to upload <strong>nucleic acids molecular dynamics trajectories</strong> using our <a href="help.php?id=datamanager">user workspace</a>. To upload a trajectory, user must be registered in myBIGNASim as an uploader user (see <a href="help.php?id=submission">help section</a>). 

	This service is still under development, and some of the functionalities might still not be enabled.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q4">
    <label for="q4">How many simulations do you have stored? </label>
    <p>	The number of simulations stored, types of nucleic acid structures, simulation lengths, etc. are graphically summarized in the <a href='stats.php'>statistics section</a> of <strong>BIGNASim portal</strong>. 

	In any case, <strong>BIGNASim</strong> is already, with a large difference, the largest database of nucleic acid trajectories, and we plan to continue extending it.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q5">
    <label for="q5">Which simulations can I find in the database? </label>
    <p>	Nucleic Acids simulations stored in this initial stage of <strong>BIGNASim</strong> database come mostly from trajectories prepared during the development and validation of the <a href='http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/www/ParmBSC1' target='_blank'>parmBSC1 forcefield</a> in our group.

	However, its structure is open to grow to include new simulations and analysis strategies: the system is neither limited in size, as database managers scale horizontally, nor complexity, as <strong>MongoDB</strong> offers a fully flexible data schema.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q6">
    <label for="q6">Do you plan to have more representation of RNA molecules? </label>
    <p>	As explained in the previous question, simulations stored in this initial stage of <strong>BIGNASim</strong> database come mostly from trajectories prepared during the development and validation of the <a href='http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/www/ParmBSC1' target='_blank'>parmBSC1 forcefield</a> in our group. As this forcefield was designed to work with <strong>DNA</strong> structures, most of the simulations stored in the database are from <strong>DNA</strong> molecules. 

	However, the next step in the <a href='http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/www/ParmBSC1' target='_blank'>parmBSC1 forcefield</a> project is the possibility to use it in <strong>RNA</strong> simulations, so in a short period of time <strong>BIGNASim</strong> will store the complete set of RNA simulations used in this new benchmarking, covering most of the representative <strong>RNA</strong> motifs. For that, we are already working on new <strong>RNA-specific</strong> analysis to integrate in the server, and we have already enriched our <a href="help.php?id=onto">Nucleic Acids Ontology</a> with new <strong>RNA-specific</strong> terms.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q7">
    <label for="q7">Can I install <strong>BIGNASim</strong> infrastructure in my own lab? </label>
    <p>	We should be aware that <strong>BIGNASim</strong> is a large and complex system, including a production installation of two <strong>noSQL databases</strong>, two <strong>web servers</strong>, one public, and another for internal communications, and a complex set of <strong>analysis software</strong>. Also, a significant amount of disk space is required to handle temporary data. It is almost impossible to design an installation procedure that covers all the system, and does not need a skilled system administrator. 

	However, we are preparing a series of pre-packed <strong>Docker images</strong> (DB and analysis site, analysis software), covering all analysis functionality, which would allow most users to set a local installation, of course with limited capacity. We are still testing the procedure, but detailed information about the download and installation procedure will be available from the site.
 
	We understand that <strong>BIGNASim</strong> infrastructure may have a value not only to share final results, but also to perform in-house analysis, or simply to store data in an ordered manner. Moreover, in the present context, most major journals require for public sharing of results, like is customary with <strong>PDB</strong>, or <strong>sequence databases</strong>. <strong>BIGNASim</strong> will be an excellent place to do so.

<section class="faq-section">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q8">
    <label for="q8">Should I register in myBIGNASim? </label>
    <p><strong>BIGNASim</strong> user workspace was designed only to keep users' data in a temporary basis to facilitate downloading of potentially large trajectories or meta-trajectories, providing a link to recover this temporary workspace at any moment (within a browser session). Thus, browsing as an <strong>Anonymous user</strong> is completely fine for a typical use of the server. 

	However, <strong>myBIGNASim</strong> offers the possibility to register and work as a logged user, with a permanent workspace (with time and size limits), that is maintained and can be accessed from any machine and at any moment. Users interested in uploading simulations must be registered in <strong>myBIGNASim</strong>.
