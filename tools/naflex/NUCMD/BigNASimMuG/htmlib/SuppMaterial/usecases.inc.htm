<p>BIGNASim has been designed in a way that advanced data  analysis can be performed  straightforwardly, even for types of analysis  that were not known at the time of the design. The following cases show some  representative examples of the possibilities of data manipulation. Most of the examples can be done within the portal, and  are already available as tutorials in <strong>BIGNASim</strong> web site. 
   The power of the <strong>BIGNASim</strong> is to store raw data in structures  that allow an easy recovery and combination, 
   either from the analysis or from the trajectory databases. Simple scripts can be used to query the databases and  
   obtain the required analyses. Scripts examples shown here are written in Javascript, the  natural language for MongoDB, 
   but most popular scripting languages can be also used. Additional information can be found at <a href="help.php">BIGNASim help site</a></p>
