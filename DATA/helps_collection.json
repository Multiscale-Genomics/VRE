This double helix is very stable, and that's partly due to the base pair hydrogen bond interactions between bases in one strand to the complementary bases in the other strand: **Purines** (***Adenine, Guanine***) with **Pyrimidines** (***Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil***). \r\n\r\n**Guanine-Cytosine** base pairs can form 3 hydrogen bond interactions, while **Adenine-Thymine/Uracil** can only form 2, thus making nucleic acid with more **GC** base pairs more stable than nucleic acid with more **AT** base pairs.\r\n\r\n![](/tools/naflex/help/img/59cc1654b6eb98.38973835.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"anchor5\"></span>\r\n\r\n \r\n## NAFlex Nucleic Acids Flexibility Analysis: HB/Stacking Energies\r\n\r\nInteraction energies between Hydrogen-Bonded Base Pairs (**HB energies**) and attractive, non-covalent interactions between aromatic rings in consecutive bases (**Stacking energies**) are two of the most useful analysis in DNA/RNA molecules. \r\n\r\n**Stacking energies** can be computed between consecutive bases and also between bases of different strands. \r\n\r\n**Hydrogen Bond energies** are known to be greater in **G-C** base pairs than in **A-T** base pairs. \r\n\r\nAnalysis results are commonly plotted as **contact maps** where nucleotide pairs are easy to identify. \r\n\r\n![](/tools/naflex/help/img/59cc17d26cdb87.57890239.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"anchor6\"></span>\r\n\r\n \r\n## NAFlex Nucleic Acids Flexibility Analysis: Distance Contact Maps\r\n\r\nInformation as the distances (for example distance mean or minimum distance) between all the pair of bases in a nucleic structure during a dynamic simulation can be very useful to obtain a picture of the **flexibility** of the structure and the movements that it undergoes during the dynamic simulation. \r\n\r\nThe most common way to look a this information is plotting it with **Contact Maps**.

Then, the coverage for those peaks is computed.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the **NucleR** pipeline performs a profile cleaning based on Fourier analysis, which both smothes the signal and cleans the distortions in the coverage peaks. By tranforming the original coverage profile into the Fourier Space using FFT, one can analyze the contribution of every frequency to the original signal. High frequencies are usually echoes of lower frequencies and sources of noise. In the case of **NucleR**, a small number of components are chosen (typically a 2%) and the rest are removed before performing the inverse FFT.\r\n\r\nThe following step is the detection of nucleosome dyads, which is done by a simple local maxima search. Nucleosome calls are determined by selecting the surrounding bases around the dyad position and some calls are merged if they overlap enough.\r\n\r\nFinally, the nucleosome calls are scored based on the height and sharpness of the peak. These height and width scores also allow to classify large and sharp peaks as *well-positioned* nucleosomes and short and wide peaks as *fuzzy* nucleosomes.\r\n\r\n![{w:600}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05bddc23dcc6.43672237.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"nd\"></span>\r\n##Nucleosome Dynamics\r\n\r\nNucleosome Dynamics is a method that allows comparison of two diferent MNase-seq experiments (Condition 1 and Condition 2) and detects local changes like:\r\n\r\n* **Upstream shifts**, were the occupancy is shifted upstream on Condition 2 relative to Condition 1.\r\n* **Downstream shifts**, were the occupancy is shifted downstream on Condition 2 relative to Condition 1.\r\n* **Inclusions**, where the nucleosome occupancy is significantly increased.\r\n* **Evictions**, where the nucleosome occupancy is significantly decreased.\r\n\r\n![{w:400}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c41c149f08.61314383.png)\r\n\r\nNucleosome Dynamics tries to identify those changes by working at a read-level. The way its pipeline works is by sequentially pairing reads of one experiment with reads of the second experiment and setting those paired reads apart.\r\n\r\nFirst, all reads that are identical on both experiments are separated. Then, the reads that either start or end at the same position are separated as well. Next, the reads from one experiment whose range is completely contained by the range of a read in the other experiment, are paired and separated too.\r\nThis first pairing, account for either differences in MNase digestion or for no differences at all, so after removing those, what's left accounts for differences.\r\n\r\nNucleosome Dynamics then pairs reads from one experiment to reads in the other experiment whose center is slightly shifted either upstream or downstream relative to each other. In an attempt to find the best possible combination of pairs, a dynamic programming algorithm is used.\r\nThe dynamic programming algorithm is set so that:\r\n\r\n1. The most number of pairs possible is found.\r\n2. The centers of the paired reads are as close as possible.\r\n3. Reads whose center is futher apart than 74 bp. are never paired.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, the dynamic programming algorithm works the following way:\r\n\r\n1. Gaps are highly penalized (to achieve maximum number of pairs).\r\n2. Pairs are given a score that is inversely proportional to the centers distance (to prioratize close pairs).\r\n3. Centers distance bigger than 74 bp. are given a score of -Infinity so that it can never happen.\r\n\r\n![{w:500}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05bf3fea9483.00379782.png)\r\n\r\nOnce the shift pairs have been found, accumulations of such are considered shift hotspots.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify significant changes in occupancy (insertions and deletions), the coverage of the reads in both experiments is used.\r\nFirst a normalized z score accross the genome is calculated, assuming a hypergeometric distrubition. This score is normalized on a 10000 bp. windows, so it takes into account fluctuations of coverage accross big segments of the genome and fins locally significant differences.\r\n\r\n![{w:400}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c138d6a735.37837933.png)\r\n\r\nPositive peaks of that z score mean that the coverage of the Experiment 1 is significantly higher than the coverage of the Experiment 2, and therefore it's considered a deletion. Similarly, negative z score peaks represent regions where the coverage of the Experiment 2 is significantly higher and therefore classified as insertions.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Nucleosome Dynamics pipeline scores the hotspots found. To do so, a p-value is calculated for each point on the sequence, that accounts statistically significant differences of coverage on a 10000 bp. window.\r\nOn 10000 bp. windows and for each position, a Fisher's test is calculated with the following contingency table.\r\n\r\n![{w:400}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c1f00702c9.47469976.png)\r\n\r\nEach hotspot is given the p-value at its peak position as score. Then a threshold is applied so that only the more relevant hotspots are reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"nfr\"></span>\r\n##Nucleosome Free Regions\r\n\r\nNucleosome Free Regions are fragments of DNA that are depleted of nucleosomes. Only regions depleted of nucleosomes shorter than a given value (400 bp. by default) are reported, since a too long nucleosome-free region is likely to just be the result of experimental artifacts.\r\n\r\n![{w:600}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c3a374d964.42740004.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"tss\"></span>\r\n##TSS Classification\r\n\r\nThe Transcription Start Site of each gene can be classified according to the nucleosomes surrounding it.\r\nFor each gene and within a window of 300 bp. both upstream and downstream, a +1 nucleosome is searched downstream of the TSS and a -1 nucleosome is searched upstream of the TSS. These two nucleosomes can be either **well-positioned** (shortened as **W**) or **fuzzy** (shortened as **F**) or can be missing.\r\nAdditionally, these two nucleosomes' dyads can be close together or further apart. If they are closer than 215 bp., we call it a **close** conformation, otherwise, we call it an **open** conformation.\r\nTaking all this information into account, a transcription start site can present any of the following conformations:\r\n\r\n* W-close-W\r\n* W-close-F\r\n* F-close-W\r\n* F-close-F\r\n* W-open-W\r\n* W-open-F\r\n* F-open-W\r\n* F-open-F\r\n* +1 missing\r\n* W - missing\r\n* F - missing\r\n\r\n![{w:600}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c67252bfe1.85966928.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"phasing\"></span>\r\n##Nucleosome Phasing\r\n\r\nIf, within a gene body, we consider the first and last nucleosomes as fixed points, the nucleosome coverage can be modelled as as two decaying sine waves (one starting from the first nucleosome and going downstream, and the other starting from the last nucleosome and going upstream) that interfere with each other.\r\n\r\n![{w:600}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c713ca9059.62865358.png)\r\n\r\nThis results in two kind of coverage profiles. If the first and last nucleosomes are in phase, the two sine waves will interact constructively and the profile will be well-positioned and defined. However, if the first and last nucleosomes are in anti-phase, the profile will be well-defined near those nucleosomes but will become fuzzier towards the center of the gene body.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, for each gene, two measures of how periodical its coverage is can be computed: a phase score and an autocorrelation.\r\n\r\nThe phase score is a measure of how much in phase the first and last nucleosomes are, and goes from 0 (for completely phased genes) to 82 (for completely anti-phased genes).\r\n\r\n![{w:400}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c7f6e60669.61198091.png)\r\n\r\nThe autocorrelation is the how correlated the nucleosome coverage with itself shifted one period.\r\n\r\n![{w:300}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c80b997bd7.32697976.png)\r\n\r\nA good period to use for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is 165 bp. but other organisms may require a different period.\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"stf\"></span>\r\n##Stiffness\r\n\r\nIf the coverage that contributes to a single nucleosome call is separated from the rest of the profile, its curve can be fitted to a Gaussian function.\r\n\r\n![{w:400}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c974e40b70.70825743.png) ![{w:200}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c986b94309.12982827.png)\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n\r\n* The parameter a controls the height of the curve's peak\r\n* The parameter b specified the position of the center of the peak\r\n* The parameter c, also called *standard deviation* controls the width of the bell\r\n\r\nThis way, it is possible to get an estimation of the nucleosome singal's standard deviation.\r\nAnd from this standard deviation, it's possible to get a stiffness constant estimation for that given nucleosome.\r\n\r\n![{w:200}](/tools/nucldynwf/help/img/5a05c9c32a4d15.58189227.png)\r\n\r\nSince the width of the nucleosome signal is related to how much that specific nucleosome position is in sync throughout the cell population, it is also a measure of how easy to move that nucleosome would be.\r\nAnd that stiffness constant estimation is a more physical approach to that measure, since it represents the amount of energy required to move that nucleosome. Therefore, fuzzier nucleosomes would have a lower stiffness constant that more well-positioned ones." }

These data are collectively referred to as the \"ABC dataset\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/tools/pdiview/help/img/5a0b3052d9b7c0.08597725.png\" alt=\"Schematic view of 3DConsensus functionality\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\n3DConsensus uses the information from two input files to analyse a protein's DNA-binding specificity: 1) the three-dimensional structure of the protein in complex with DNA, and 2) experimental data on the protein's binding affinity. The two sets of data are analysed in terms of **sequence readout** and **shape readout** as explained below.\r\n\r\n### Structural data\r\n<img src=\"/tools/pdiview/help/img/5a0b3061cfb828.91734679.png\" alt=\"Analysis of structural data within 3DConsensus\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\nThe structural data is analysed to identify the intermolecular interactions that are formed between the protein and the DNA, in terms of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions between charged groups and Van-der-Waals contacts between apolar moyeties. Some of these interactions are at the basis of the DNA-sequence-dependent binding specificity, participating in the **sequence readout**.\r\n\r\nThe protein-DNA complex structure is also analysed to characterise its conformation, through the calculation of  helical parameters (see Figure) [Lavery *et al.* (2009) NAR(37) 5917–5929](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/17/5917). Analysis of the helical parameters (see Figure below) allows the evaluation of the extent and direction of the deformation of the DNA in the complex. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/tools/pdiview/help/img/5a0b36c083c913.08938507.png\" alt=\"The 12 helical parameters of DNA (Image courtesy of Curves+)\" style=\"height: 150px;\"/>\r\n\r\nIn the example below, the helical parameter \"Buckle\" is plotted as a function of the sequence of the DNA in the complex. Together with the values of the parameters in the protein-DNA complex structure that is being analysed, the plot also shows the corresponding values for a DNA molecule of the same sequence in the absence of the protein (the shaded area corresponds to its standard deviation). Finally, the line indicates the average value of the \"Buckle\" parameter in B-DNA (over many different sequences). Both of these latter values are predicted using data from the \"ABC dataset\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/tools/pdiview/help/img/5a0b306e0db1e9.99697128.png\" alt=\"Example of Helical parameter plot for the Buckle parameter\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\nComparison of the three sets of data allows the deconvolution of two effects that determine the structure of the DNA molecule in the complex with the protein: the effect of the sequence of DNA, and that of the presence of the protein, shedding light on the **shape readout** process.\r\n\r\n### Sequence data\r\n<img src=\"/tools/pdiview/help/img/5a0b3077d60588.66024022.png\" alt=\"Analysis of binding data within 3DConsensus\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\nThe experimental data is processed using standard PWM (Position Weight Matrix) methods to derive a sequence consensus, represented as a sequence logo, where the height of each letter represents the log likelihood of finding that base at that position within the binding site. This can be interpreted to represent the binding selectivity in terms of **sequence readout**.\r\nOn the other hand, we leverage the detailed information on the sequence-dependent structure of naked DNA available thanks to the analysis of the \"ABC dataset\", to predict the structure of DNA in the experimentally-derived sequences, and use these predictions to construct what we call a \"shape consensus\".\r\nThe \"shape consensus\" is obtained by dividing the range of values observed for each helical parameter within the \"ABC dataset\" in 4 subranges, whose boundaries are its quartiles. We then assign a letter to each subrange: **S**mall, **M**edium, **L**arge and **X**tra-large, and use these as labels to construct a logo plot which is similar in nature to the \"sequence consensus\", but conveys information about the **shape readout**.  In fact, the height of each letter in the \"shape consensus\" expresses the log likelihood of finding a given range of values at that position within the binding site.  \r\n\r\n<hr style=\"margin-bottom: 2px\" />\r\n<nav aria-label=\"paginator\"><ul class=\"pager\">\r\n <li class=\"previous\"><a href=\"https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu/tools/pdiview/help/inputs.php\"><i class=\"fa fa-arrow-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Previous: Inputs</a></li>\r\n <li class=\"next\"><a href=\"https://vre.multiscalegenomics.eu/tools/pdiview/help/outputs.php\">Next: Outputs<i class=\"fa fa-arrow-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a></li>\r\n</ul></nav>\r\n" }

Maximum molecule length parameter depends on the size of the sequenced fragments.\r\n* too close from REs: semi-dangling-end filter, start position of one of the read is too close (5 bp by default) from RE cutting site (with 4 base-pair-cutter enzyme it can be set to 4 nt). This filter is in general not taken into account in in-situ Hi-C experiments, and with 4bp cutters as the ligation may happen only one side of the DNA fragments.\r\n* too short: remove reads coming from small restriction less than 100 bp (default) because they are comparable to the read length, and are thus probably artifacts.\r\n* too large: remove reads coming from large restriction fragments (default: 100 Kb, P < 10-5 to occur in a randomized genome) as they likely represent poorly assembled or repeated regions\r\n* over-represented: reads coming from the top 0.5% most frequently detected restriction fragments, they may be prone to PCR artifacts or represent fragile regions of the genome or genome assembly errors\r\n* duplicated: the combination of the start positions (and direction) of the reads is repeated -> PCR artifact (only keep one copy)\r\n* random breaks: start position of one of the read is too far (more than Minimum distance to RE site) from RE cutting site.

This plot is done over the first milion reads, as this is usually enough to asses the general quality of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe second plot, is specific to Hi-C experiments. Given a restriction enzyme the function searches for the presence of ligation sites and of undigested restriction enzyme sites. Depending on the enzyme used the function can differentiate between dangling-ends and undigested sites.\r\n\r\nFrom this proportion some qulaity statistic can be inferred before the mapping: - The percentage of digested sites wich is the ratio of digested over undigested sites found over the reads analyzed - The percentage os dangling-ends which is the number of time a digested site is found at the begining of a read - The percentage of ligation sites which is the number of times a ligation site is found in the processed reads. This number has to be transfrom to reflect the reality as it corresponds only to the sequenced part of the DNA fragment. For example, in this case, if the mean fragment size is 400 nucleotides and we found that 11% of 1 million reads present 1 ligation site, we should expect a proportional number of ligation sites in the insert (unsequenced space between the ends of the reads).\r\n\r\n## Distribution of dangling-ends lengths\r\n\r\n![](/tools/tadbit_map_parse_filter/help/img/5a076b4fcc2444.67429152.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to confirm the size of the inserts fed to the sequencer, we can look at the distribution of genomic distances between the mapped read1 and read2 of dangling-ends.

This quality check is similar to the tests performed by the [FastQC program](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) with adaptions for Hi-C datasets.\r\n\r\n**Iterative mapping**\r\n\r\nTADbit implements an iterative mapping strategy that is a slightly modified version of the original ICE method developed for the HiClib library as proposed by [Imakaev2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941365). The minimal differences with the original ICE method are the mapper used (TADbit uses [GEM](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2221)) and a more flexible way to define the position of the iterative mapping windows, which can now be fully defined by the user.\r\n\r\n**Fragment based filtering**\r\n\r\nThe filtering strategy implemented in TADbit builds on previously [described protocols](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2148) to correct all the computationally detectable experimental biases/errors. After mapping, TADbit can filter the reads depending on ten criteria, which can be applied individually or as a set of filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n" }

At the highest level, chromosomes occupy characteristic nuclear areas or “chromosome territories”, separated by inter-chromatin compartments.

A correlation matrix is then calculated from this normalized matrix, and its first eigenvector is used to identify compartments. Changes in sign mark the boundaries between compartments. Finally if possible, A and B compartments can be infered using GC content computed from reference genomes available in the VRE (high GC content usually found in A compartments).\r\n\r\n### Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)\r\n\r\nThe TADbit algorithm works on raw chromosome interaction count data. The normalization is neither necessary nor recommended, since the data is assumed to be discrete counts. TADbit is a breakpoint detection algorithm that returns the optimal segmentation of the chromosome under BIC-penalized likelihood. The model assumes that counts have a Poisson distribution and that the expected value of the counts decreases like a power-law with the linear distance on the chromosome. This expected value of the counts at position (i,j) is corrected by the counts at diagonal positions (i,i) and (j,j). This normalizes for different restriction enzyme site densities and 'mappability' of the reads in case a bin contains repeated regions." }
