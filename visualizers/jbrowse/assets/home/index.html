					<p>JBrowse is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with JavaScript and HTML5, with optional run-once data formatting tools written in Perl.

					<p>Headline Features:</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Fast, smooth scrolling and zooming. Explore your genome with unparalleled speed.</li>
					<li>Scales easily to multi-gigabase genomes and deep-coverage sequencing.</li>
					<li>Supports GFF3, BED, FASTA, Wiggle, BigWig, BAM, VCF (with tabix), REST, and more.  BAM, BigWig, and VCF data are displayed directly from chunks of the compressed binary files, no conversion needed.</li>
					<li>Includes an optional “faceted” track selector suitable for large installations with thousands of tracks.</li>
					<li>Very light server resource requirements. In fact, JBrowse has no back-end server code, just tools for formatting data files to be read directly over HTTP. Serve huge datasets from a single low-cost cloud instance.</li>
					<li>Can run as a stand-alone app on OSX and Windows.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>JBrowse has been integrated into MuG VRE to allow users to visualize their data. Several reference genomes have been included, as well as many tracks. All supported assemblies include a Genes track and some of them have other additional tracks.</p>
					<p>You can see the list of supported assemblies here: <a href="https://www.multiscalegenomics.eu/MuGVRE/available-assemblies/" target="_blank">https://www.multiscalegenomics.eu/MuGVRE/available-assemblies/</a></p>
