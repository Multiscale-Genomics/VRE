.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a fast, low-level parser for Generic Feature Format, version 3
(\s-1GFF3\s0).  It is a low-level parser, it only returns dumb hashrefs.  It
\&\fBdoes\fR reconstruct feature hierarchies, however, using features'
\&\f(CW\*(C`ID\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Parent\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Derives_from\*(C'\fR attributes, and it \fBdoes\fR group
together lines with the same \s-1ID \s0(i.e. features that have multiple
locations).
.PP
\fIFeatures\fR
.IX Subsection "Features"
.PP
Features are returned as arrayrefs containing one or more (never zero)
feature lines parsed in the same format as
\&\*(L"gff3_parse_feature\*(R" in Bio::GFF3::LowLevel.  Each has some additional
keys for related features: \f(CW\*(C`child_features\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`derived_features\*(C'\fR,
each of which is a (possibly empty) arrayref of features
(i.e. arrayrefs) that refer to this one as a \f(CW\*(C`Parent\*(C'\fR or claim that
they \f(CW\*(C`Derives_from\*(C'\fR it.
.PP
Note that, to make code that uses this parser easier to write, \fBall\fR
features have \f(CW\*(C`child_features\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`derived_features\*(C'\fR arrayrefs.
This means you don't have to check for the existence of these before
seeing if they have anything in them.
.PP
\fIDirectives\fR
.IX Subsection "Directives"
.PP
Directives are returned as hashrefs, in the same format as
\&\*(L"gff3_parse_directive\*(R" in Bio::GFF3::LowLevel.
.PP
\fIComments\fR
.IX Subsection "Comments"
.PP
Comments are parsed into a hashref of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { comment => \*(Aqtext of the comment, not including the hash mark(s) and ending newline\*(Aq }

.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.ie n .SS "open( $file_or_filehandle, ... )"
.el .SS "open( \f(CW$file_or_filehandle\fP, ... )"
.IX Subsection "open( $file_or_filehandle, ... )"
Make a new parser object that will parse the \s-1GFF3\s0 from all of the files
or filehandles that you give it, as if they were all a single stream.
.ie n .SS "max_lookback( $features )"
.el .SS "max_lookback( \f(CW$features\fP )"
.IX Subsection "max_lookback( $features )"
Set a maximum number of features the parser will keep buffered in case
there are features later in the file referring to it.  By default,
there is no limit, with the parser instead relying on the presence of
\&'###' marks in the \s-1GFF3\s0 file.
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
Returns a wrapped copy of this parser that returns data that is backward-compatible with what the 1.0 version of this parser returned.  Do not use in new code.
.SS "\fInext_item()\fP"
.IX Subsection "next_item()"
Iterate through all of the items (features, directives, and comments)
in the file(s) given to the parser.  Features are arrayrefs of
hashrefs, and directives and comments are hashrefs.
