.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store::GFF3Loader object parsers GFF3\-format
sequence annotation files and loads Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
databases. For certain combinations of SeqFeature classes and
SeqFeature::Store databases it features a \*(L"fast load\*(R" mode which will
greatly accelerate the loading of \s-1GFF3\s0 databases by a factor of 5\-10.
.PP
The \s-1GFF3\s0 file format has been extended very slightly to accommodate
Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store. First, the loader recognizes is a new
directive:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  # #index\-subfeatures [0|1]
.Ve
.PP
Note that you can place a space between the two #'s in order to
prevent \s-1GFF3\s0 validators from complaining.
.PP
If this is true, then subfeatures are indexed (the default) so that
they can be retrieved with a query. See Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
for an explanation of this. If false, then subfeatures can only be
accessed through their parent feature.
.PP
Second, the loader recognizes a new attribute tag called index, which
if present, controls indexing of the current feature. Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ctg123 . TF_binding_site 1000 1012 . + . ID=tfbs00001;index=1
.Ve
.PP
You can use this to turn indexing on and off, overriding the default
for a particular feature.
.PP
Note that the loader keeps a record \*(-- in memory \*(-- of each feature
that it has processed. If you find the loader running out of memory on
particularly large \s-1GFF3\s0 files, please split the input file into
smaller pieces and do the load in steps.
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 6
\& Title   : new
\& Usage   : $loader = Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store::GFF3Loader\->new(@options)
\& Function: create a new parser
\& Returns : a Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store::GFF3Loader gff3 parser and loader
\& Args    : several \- see below
\& Status  : public
.Ve
.PP
This method creates a new \s-1GFF3\s0 loader and establishes its connection
with a Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store database. Arguments are \-name=>$value
pairs as described in this table:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& Name               Value
\& \-\-\-\-               \-\-\-\-\-
\&
\& \-store             A writable Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store database handle.
\&
\& \-seqfeature_class  The name of the type of Bio::SeqFeatureI object to create
\&                      and store in the database (Bio::DB::SeqFeature by default)
\&
\& \-sf_class          A shorter alias for \-seqfeature_class
\&
\& \-verbose           Send progress information to standard error.
\&
\& \-fast              If true, activate fast loading (see below)
\&
\& \-chunk_size        Set the storage chunk size for nucleotide/protein sequences
\&                       (default 2000 bytes)
\&
\& \-tmp               Indicate a temporary directory to use when loading non\-normalized
\&                       features.
\&
\& \-ignore_seqregion  Ignore ##sequence\-region directives. The default is to create a
\&                       feature corresponding to the directive.
\&
\& \-noalias_target    Don\*(Aqt create an Alias attribute for a target_id named in a 
\&                    Target attribute. The default is to create an Alias
\&                    attribute containing the target_id found in a Target 
\&                    attribute.
.Ve
.PP
When you call \fInew()\fR, a connection to a Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
database should already have been established and the database
initialized (if appropriate).
.PP
Some combinations of Bio::SeqFeatures and Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
databases support a fast loading mode. Currently the only reliable
implementation of fast loading is the combination of DBI::mysql with
Bio::DB::SeqFeature. The other important restriction on fast loading
is the requirement that a feature that contains subfeatures must occur
in the \s-1GFF3\s0 file before any of its subfeatures. Otherwise the
subfeatures that occurred before the parent feature will not be
attached to the parent correctly. This restriction does not apply to
normal (slow) loading.
.PP
If you use an unnormalized feature class, such as
Bio::SeqFeature::Generic, then the loader needs to create a temporary
database in which to cache features until all their parts and subparts
have been seen. This temporary databases uses the \*(L"berkeleydb\*(R"
adaptor. The \-tmp option specifies the directory in which that
database will be created. If not present, it defaults to the system
default tmp directory specified by File::Spec\->\fItmpdir()\fR.
.PP
The \-chunk_size option allows you to tune the representation of
DNA/Protein sequence in the Store database. By default, sequences are
split into 2000 base/residue chunks and then reassembled as
needed. This avoids the problem of pulling a whole chromosome into
memory in order to fetch a short subsequence from somewhere in the
middle. Depending on your usage patterns, you may wish to tune this
parameter using a chunk size that is larger or smaller than the
default.
.SS "ignore_seqregion"
.IX Subsection "ignore_seqregion"
.Vb 1
\&  $ignore_it = $loader\->ignore_seqregion([$new_flag])
.Ve
.PP
Get or set the ignore_seqregion flag, which if true, will cause 
\&\s-1GFF3\s0 ##sequence\-region directives to be ignored. The default behavior
is to create a feature corresponding to the region.
.SS "noalias_target"
.IX Subsection "noalias_target"
.Vb 1
\&  $noalias_target = $loader\->noalias_target([$new_flag])
.Ve
.PP
Get or set the noalias_target flag, which if true, will disable the creation of
an Alias attribute for a target_id named in a Target attribute. The default is 
to create an Alias attribute containing the target_id found in a Target 
attribute.
.SS "load"
.IX Subsection "load"
.Vb 6
\& Title   : load
\& Usage   : $count = $loader\->load(@ARGV)
\& Function: load the indicated files or filehandles
\& Returns : number of feature lines loaded
\& Args    : list of files or filehandles
\& Status  : public
.Ve
.PP
Once the loader is created, invoke its \fIload()\fR method with a list of
\&\s-1GFF3\s0 or \s-1FASTA\s0 file paths or previously-opened filehandles in order to
load them into the database. Compressed files ending with .gz, .Z and
\&.bz2 are automatically recognized and uncompressed on the fly. Paths
beginning with http: or ftp: are treated as URLs and opened using the
\&\s-1LWP GET\s0 program (which must be on your path).
.PP
\&\s-1FASTA\s0 files are recognized by their initial \*(L">\*(R" character. Do not feed
the loader a file that is neither \s-1GFF3\s0 nor \s-1FASTA\s0; I don't know what
will happen, but it will probably not be what you expect.
.SS "accessors"
.IX Subsection "accessors"
The following read-only accessors return values passed or created during \fInew()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& store()          the long\-term Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store object
\&
\& tmp_store()      the temporary Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store object used
\&                    during loading
\&
\& sfclass()        the Bio::SeqFeatureI class
\&
\& fast()           whether fast loading is active
\&
\& seq_chunk_size() the sequence chunk size
\&
\& verbose()        verbose progress messages
