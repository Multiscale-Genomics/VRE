## optionally sort the faceted track selector by column (use the names from displayColumns)
# initialSortColumn=label
## optionally give different names to some of the data facets
## displayed in the track selector
# [trackSelector.renameFacets]
# submission = Submission ID
# developmental-stage = Conditions
# cell-line = Cell Line
# key = Dataset
# label = Track
## configure where to get metadata about tracks.  always indexes the
## `metadata` part of each track config, but this can be used to load
## additional metadata from CSV or JSON urls
# [trackMetadata]
# sources = data/trackMetadata.csv

[GENERAL]
## default tracks
defaultTracks = DNA 

## to set a default data directory other than 'data', uncomment and
## edit the line below
# dataRoot = data

## optionally add more include statements to load and merge in more
## configuration files
include  = {dataRoot}/trackList.json
include += {dataRoot}/tracks.conf
# include += ../url/of/my/other/config.json
# include += another_config.conf

## uncomment and edit the example below to enable one or more
## JBrowse plugins
# [ plugins.MyPlugin ]
# location = plugins/MyPlugin
# [ plugins.AnotherPlugin ]
# location = ../plugin/dir/someplace/else

## uncomment to change the default sort order of the reference
## sequence dropdown
# refSeqOrder = name 

## edit the datasets list below to add datasets to the jbrowse dataset
## selector

# [datasets.volvox]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/volvox
# name = Volvox Example

# [datasets.modencode]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/modencode
# name = MODEncode Example

# [datasets.yeast]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/yeast
# name = Yeast Example

## add a document.domain to set the same-origin policy
# documentDomain=foobar.com


## enable or disable high resolution rendering for canvas features 
## default: 'disabled' since this is a beta feature
## use 'auto' to auto-detect settings on the users browser
## use a number to specify a custom backing store ratio on the users browser
# highResolutionMode=disabled
