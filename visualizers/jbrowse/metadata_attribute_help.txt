STF_Score	Stiffness estimation. It is the energy required to move the nucleosome (expressed in cal/bp), it is derived from the gaussian standard deviation.
STF_nucleR_class	the nucleR class given to that nucleosome
STF_nucleR_score	the nucleR score given to that nucleosome
STF_gauss_k	the height of the peak of the gaussian curve
STF_gauss_m	the position of the peak of the gaussian curve
STF_gauss_sd	the standard deviation of the gaussian curve
ND_Position	region where the movement happens
ND_Type	change in the nucleosome map
ND_Score	is the area of the coverage of the reads involved in the movement relative to the area of the coverage of all the reads present in the movement range	
ND_coord	the position of the hotspot peak
ND_class	type of hotspot (see help for all possible types)
ND_nuc	to which nucleosome the movement belongs. NA means that the hostpot could not be unequivocally associated to one nucleosome.
ND_number_of_reads	number of reads involved in this movement
ND_freads	number of reads involved in the hotspot divided by the number of reads in the chromosome.
ND_readsInvolved	number of reads involved in this hotspot
ND_hreads	number of reads involved in the movement relative to the number of reads present in the area. This value ranges from 0 to 1 and the closest it is to 1, the more significant the movement.
ND_nreads	is the number of reads involved in the hotspot
NR_Score	Positionning score. It is calculated as the weighted sum of width and height scores.
NR_score_width	Witdth score. It is a measure of how sharp a peak is. A value of 0 would be an extremely wide peak and a value of 1 a very sharp one.
NR_score_height	Height score. Tells how large a peak of a nucleosome is. The bigger this number, the higher the peak.
NR_nmerge	Number of original overlapped ranged merged into one. Higher numbers indicate fuzzier nucleosomes.
NR_class	Whether the nucleosome is well-positioned (W) or fuzzy (F). The taken value depends on score_height and score_width. Undetermined means the exact position of the nucleosome cannot be determined due to strong fuzziness.
P_nucleosome_first	First nucleosome of the gene.
P_nucleosome_last	Last nucleosome of the gene.
P_score_phase	Is a measure of the phase between the first and the last nucleosome. A score of 0 means the nucleosome are completely phased and a score of 82 corresponds to totally antiphased nucleosomes.
P_nucleosome	A score of 0 means the nucleosome are completely phased and a score of 82 corresponds to totally antiphased nucleosomes.
P_score_autocorrelation	It is directly computed from the experimental coverage and is quantitative measure of the periodicity of nucleosomes inside the gene body.
TSS_Position	Region between two nucleosomes surrounding the TSS.
TSS_classification	Descriptor of the Transcription Start Site. See the help for possible options.
TSS_distance	Distance in base pairs between the nucleosome +1 and the nucleosome -1.
TSS_gene_id	ID of the gene
TSS_nucleosome_minus1	Position of the nucleosome -1.
TSS_nucleosome_plus1	Position of the nucleosome +1
TSS_TSS_position	Position of the Transcription Start Site.
